#Formatting
"""Will include headers, subtitles, ..."""
Import necessary modules (e.g. Matplotlib,...)

#Stock data retrieval and analysis
User is asked to input a stock symbol
If it is formatted right:
  Import stock data from Yahoo finance
  Show data on a graph
  Calculate P/E ratios
If it is not formatted right:
  Output a message specifying that the stock data could not be retrieved due because the input was wrongly formatted.

#DCF
If DCF data is available:
  Calculate metrics of a basic DCF
  Show results on a table or graph
  Allow user to change the assumptions made (within logical bounds?)

If DCF data is not available:
  Print a message saying "DCF data not available".

#Adding the stock to the profile
Add a button letting the user add the stock name to a list linked to their profile (with a description?).
"""Stock name should then appear in their profile and be used in the machine learning to connect them to other users."""

#New stock data retrieval and analysis
Either keep the initial stock search bar and let the user enter as many stock names as they want. 
Or have a "New Search" button which, when pressed, will reset the page.

#Potential add ons
- to allow users to retrieve data for more than one stock
- to allow users to compare stock data between two stocks
- to track the amount of views of a stock and rank them
  - could then be used in a "most popular stocks" column in the community tab
