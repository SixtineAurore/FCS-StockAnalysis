## sqlite3 ##
sqlite3 is a lightweight, self-contained SQL database engine that is built into many programming languages, including Python. It is an embedded database that does not require a separate server process, making it ideal for small to medium-sized applications, prototyping, and situations where simplicity and portability are important.

Key Features of SQLite:
Serverless: Unlike many database systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite doesn’t need a server to run. It operates within the application using it.
Self-contained: The entire database is stored in a single file, making it easy to deploy and share.
Zero Configuration: No setup or installation is required to use it, making it extremely easy to use for quick projects or local storage needs.
Lightweight: SQLite is designed to be a simple, fast, and reliable database system with low overhead.
SQL Compliant: It supports most of the SQL standards (though it may not have advanced features of larger systems like stored procedures).
# .iloc[-1] is a method used with pandas DataFrames or Series to access the last row or element based on its integer index position. Here’s how it works:

df.iloc[-1]: Retrieves the entire last row of the DataFrame df.
df.iloc[-1][column_name]: Retrieves the value of column_name in the last row.
.iloc[-1] is especially helpful for time series data where you might want the most recent entry.
